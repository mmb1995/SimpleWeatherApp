# SunnyDays

A simple weather app that allows users to get a five day weather forecast for a given zip code. In addition, the app tells the
user when they can first expect to see sun in the upcoming forecast. This app was based off an old class assignment and is not
intended to be a robust weather app.

## User Stories/Objectives

- As a user, I want to see if and when there will be any sun in the near future.
- As a user, I want to see a future weather forecast so I can plan to spend time in the sun.
